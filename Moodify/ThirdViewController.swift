Moving can help you sort out your thoughts and reflect!)"

Now let’s reflect on your day: What are somethings that you could do to relieve your stress? You could talk to a loved one or take a break from your daily tasks to relax. There is always someone you can talk too! (Bonus: Breath in deeply through your nose and breath out slowly from your mouth!)"

Often when we’re upset little things can feel amplified. Take a deep breath and try to stay calm in frustrating situations. Can you fix what you’re angry about? Forgiveness of yourself and others is key. Try going outside and getting fresh air! Take in all the nature and beauty of the world! (Bonus: Take a step back and get a new perspective!)"
